  title: About Skaftin Selects
  description: >+
    Skaftin Selects cares about authentic, skillfully crafted music, design,
    film, fashion and youth culture. We are the crate diggers of the internet
    era. We love niche abstract and unique art. Whether it be the dope vibes of
    Little Dragon to the majestic animation of Hayao Miyazaki. We love smart
    games such as Dark Souls. We discuss line work of new artists like
    wizzadaking. We rewatch the works of the greats such as Quentin Tarantino.
    We don’t focus on only one genre or totally discount the mainstream. We
    believe that appreciating skill, originality and creativity we can find a
    delicate balance between what’s popular and the deep underground.
