  title: About Skaftin Selects
  description: >+
    Skaftin Selects cares about authentic, skillfully crafted music, design,
    film, fashion and youth culture. We are the crate diggers of the internet
    era. We love niche abstract and unique art. Whether it be the dope vibes of
    Little Dragon to the majestic animation of Hayao Miyazaki. We love smart
    games such as Dark Souls. We discuss line work of new artists like
    wizzadaking. We rewatch the works of the greats such as Quentin Tarantino.
    We don’t focus on only one genre or totally discount the mainstream. We
    believe that appreciating skill, originality and creativity we can find a
    delicate balance between what’s popular and the deep underground.

        @theFruityguy, @palesa, @sungrizzle are joined by a local artist to
        discuss trending topics in the kulture as well as the grind of being a
        creative in today's insta-kulture. This show is more geared to more of
        the mainstream with an even divide between local African acts and
        international acts. New episodes drop once a month.

    Find a flavour for your ear. With today's busy lifestyle it is increasingly
    difficult to find good quality music. Many of us don’t have the time to
    create music libraries of the songs we love. While we have intelligent music
    recommendations, they never quite hit the mark. If only you had someone who
    loves the same music you do and created a playlist for you. That’s why I
    created Skaftin Selects. Curating everyone's tastes isn’t easy. The more I
    thought about it, the more sub-genres and nuances there were. The only
    alternative to using an algorithm was to share music with people who love
    music as much as I do. It’s kind of like when we used to swap mixtapes - but
    better.
